Gadgetbridge
============

This implementation for the Fossil Q hybrid is not officially supported by Fossil nor does Fossil provide any warranty concerning the functionality of this code.

Gadgetbridge is an Android (4.4+) application which will allow you to use your
Pebble, Mi Band, Amazfit Bip and HPlus device (and more) without the vendor's closed source application
and without the need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the
vendor's servers.

## Features

Please see [FEATURES.md](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/src/master/FEATURES.md)

## Getting Started (Pebble)

Please [this wiki article](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Pebble-Getting-Started) 

## How to use (Mi Band 1+2)

* Invoke the discovery activity  manually via the "+" button. It will ask you for some personal info that appears
  to be needed for proper steps calculation on the band. If you do not provide these,
  some hardcoded default "dummy" values will be used instead. 

  When your Mi Band starts to vibrate and blink during the pairing process,
  tap it quickly a few times in a row to confirm the pairing with the band.

1. Configure other notifications as desired
2. Go back to the "Gadgetbridge" activity
3. Tap the Mi Band item to connect if you're not connected yet
4. To test, chose "Debug" from the menu and play around

**Known Issues:**

* The initial connection to a Mi Band sometimes takes a little patience. Try to connect a few times, wait, 
  and try connecting again. This only happens until you have "bonded" with the Mi Band, i.e. until it 
  knows your MAC address. This behavior may also only occur with older firmware versions.
* If you use other apps like Mi Fit, and "bonding" with Gadgetbridge does not work, please
  try to unpair the band in the other app and try again with Gadgetbridge.
* While all Mi Band devices are supported, some firmware versions might work better than others.
  You can consult the [projects wiki pages](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Mi-Band) 
  to check if your firmware version is fully supported or if an upgrade/downgrade might be beneficial.
* In order to display text notifications on the Mi Band 2, you have to [install a font on the band](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Mi-Band-2).

* set time (automatically upon connection)
