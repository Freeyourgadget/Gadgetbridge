        You are trying to submit a request for a device implementation into Gadgetbridge. 
        **We cannot make any promise that the device will be implemented**, as adding an implementation 
        for a new device requires either an experienced or a willing to learn developer, 
        ideally with the device at hand. Without that, you may try to submit a device request 
        and see if anyone steps up and implements it and you are basically indicating that you 
        have the device and are willing to help with testing, should anyone try to add 
        this device to Gadgetbridge.

        - label: I have checked the [website](https://gadgetbridge.org) and [gadget list](https://gadgetbridge.org/gadgets/), and I didn't find this device mentioned there.

        - label: I have read and understood the [Codeberg Terms of Use](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/branch/main/TermsOfUse.md) for images or other type of content that I included here.

      label: Which gadget are you requesting support for?
      description: Please specify name, manufacturer, model and firmware version if possible.
      placeholder: e.g. ExampleWatch A1 with 0.1 firmware

      label: Does this gadget have similarities to other gadgets?
      description: >
        If the gadget you request support for has similarities to other gadgets that we currently support,
        it is more likely for us (still, not guaranteed) to add support for your gadget too.
  - type: textarea
    id: info
    attributes:
      label: Device information
      description: >
        Include all details about the gadget that will be useful to us when implementing a support for this gadget. 
        
        Ideally, use an Android Bluetooth scanner app like nRF Connect or BLExplorer and provide screenshots 
        of the scanned gadget from that app. This provides a name and some available UUIDs, which are needed 
        for implementation. You may want to blur MAC addresses for privacy reasons.
      placeholder: If you want to include logs, don't include it here. Use the next text field for that.

      label: Do you have logs?
      description: >
        If possible, please attach [logs](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Log-Files)
        which might help to implement the device support into Gadgetbridge. This will be automatically 
        formatted into code, so no need for backticks.
